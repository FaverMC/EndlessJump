# EndlessJump
This project contains the Server, GameAPI and the Game (EndlessJump) itself.
All you need to run this is compiling the project and execute.
If no redis server is running and configured you won't have persistant stats.

EndlessJump utilized an existed minestom launcher and some parts from the EnderCube project.
